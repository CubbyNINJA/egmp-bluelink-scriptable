# Shortcuts
Shortcuts can be added to your homescreen or Mission Control drop down to perform actions with a single press. 

### Base Shortcuts
For ease of maintance there are 2 base shortcuts that should be installed. 

Set EGMP Script allows you to set the name of the scriptable script name once, so if a name changes you update 1 shortcut instead of them all, simlar like a global/constant variable.

# Automations

Using IOS Shortcuts it is possible to configure a number if automations. A automation is a combination of a defined shortcut and then an automation that will trigger that shortcut [based on a IOS supported event](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/apd932ff833f/ios). Both the shortcut itself and the automation are created within the Shortcuts app.

Any shortcut automation will need to invoke the app with a given command - as a text string. The list of commands are described on the [Siri](./siri.md) page.

Below are a few example automations, and their downloadable Shortcut script(s). The provided shortcuts are examples, and should be modified by you to be appropiate for what you want to achieve.

### Walk Away Lock

This automation will send a lock command to the car, after a delay. The triggering event can either be disconnecting from CarPlay or disconnecting from the Car's Bluetooth.
