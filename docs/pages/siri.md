# Siri Support

The app supports direct Siri interaction via the "Shortcuts" IOS app. A Shortcut donwload link is provided below that will install a shortcut called "Ask the Car"

[Install "Ask the Car" Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b3bd704fa2bf4c6dabceec096c291342)

Once installed, interact with the shortcut by saying **"Hey Siri, Ask the car"**. Siri will respond by asking **"Whats the Command?"** and you can reply with a natural text string, which will be passed to the app. The app identifies the commands by matching specific keywords, listed below.

A interaction starts by you asking Siri to run the shortcut name, in this case its named "Start the Car", hence an interaction is like: 

**You: "Hey Siri, Ask the car"**  *(This runs the shortcut)*  
**Siri: "Whats the Command?"**  *(The shortcut prompts for some input)*    
**You: "What's the status of the car?"**  *(Your input will be sent to the app)*   
**Siri: "Your Ioniq 5's battery is at 75% and locked. Your car is also charging at 6kw and will be finished at 9pm"** *(This is the response from the app that Siri will read to you)*

You can change the name of the shortcut, or the command prompt - just remember if you change the name - thats what you have to say to start the interation.

a list of supported commands can be found in features.md
