# Region and Brand Support
{: .fs-9 }

The app uses the publically exposed BlueLink API, it is un-documented and varies in specification across both manufacturer and region.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

As such support for each region / manufacturer requires custom development and testing. The current level of support is shown below.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

I am actively looking for e-gmp car owners from regions/manufacturers I do not currently support that would be willing to provide access to their account so I can develop support for there manufactuer and/or region. If your willing please [DM me on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/andyfase/).
