It provides a limited feature set but has a fresher more responsive UI, providing both widget and Siri/Shortcuts integration.

Note: bluelink-scriptable is very much still in beta, it currently only supports the Canadian region.

I am actively looking for e-gmp car owners from other regions that would be willing to work with me so I can develop and test the APIs for their regions (US and Europe specifically). If your willing please [DM me on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/andyfase/). It would likely take less than a couple of days to implement and maybe 2 hours of active time using your bluelink account.
