# Hyundai / Kia E-GMP scriptable app for IOS
{: .fs-9 }

A [scriptable app](https://scriptable.app/) for IOS that allows you to control your Hyundai / Kia electric car using the Bluelink API. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

It provides a limited feature set but has a fresher more responsive UI, providing both widget and Siri/Shortcuts integration. Consider it a add-on to the offical app, which makes you less angry :-)
